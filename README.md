# terraria-3ds-pcap
This repo will contain all the info and files I dump that are related to Terraria 3ds. I will be attempting to make 3ds and PC terraria cross-platform similar to Minecraft geyser. I also will be attempting to make a way to play Terraria with your friends on other networks.

**Day 1**
Today I found that the 3ds disconnects from my hotspot when I search for games not allowing me to wireshark it. I probably need to use my raspberry pi in monitoring mode to capture these packets. I did note that when I quit home the 3ds briefly showed "Local" instead of "Internet" leading me to believe that the Terraria games are not reliant on a wifi network but connect without it. I am going to try to dump the traffic on the 3ds itself.
